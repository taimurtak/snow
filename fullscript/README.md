This is a DBT project, showcasing my grasp on managing data models using DBT and deploying them on Snowflake. The sample data is pulled from 
- "source" contains source definitions for pulling from snowflake example schema
- "data" contains base models that serve as wrappers around source models to define column names and data types 
- "staging" contains normalized view of the data.
- "tables" represent dimensional warehouse.
